# How to use
in the constructor of Scrooge.java there are 2 lines
		CreateUsers(10,10);
and 
		CurrentBlock= new Block(null,10);
these are respectively used to initalize the number of users,coins pairs. (2,3) in Create users means 2 users and 10 coins  
the second one initalized the size of the block so (null,2) means 2 transactions per block. change them if you wanna test quickly.



# Run Simulation
After users are created keep pressing Enter to simulate a new list of transaction. 
To terminate the code press SPACE then ENTER
